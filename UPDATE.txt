Issues:
1.  The "openqa" library required by KOSearch.java is missing.
2.  It is better to explain abbreviations (like "KO") before use them.  This documentation may help the student who will work on this project after you graduate.
3.  The project "ant" file is not created.  
4.  In "PathwayMap.java" line 78, comparison between String object should use ".euqals()" method.
